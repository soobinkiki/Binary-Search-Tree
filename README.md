# Binary Search Tree (Alan AI)

## Description
Developed the Binary Search Tree application. It is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:
- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
- The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.

It is useful to implement binary search tree in any situation where the elements can be compared in a less than or greater than manner.
